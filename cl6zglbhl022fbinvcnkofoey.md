## Uptick Network Testnet Cosmos Blokchaininde

We’d like to take this opportunity to thank our community for partaking in Phase I of the Uptick Network Testnet. In this article, we will provide statistics for this testing period, along with the qualifying addresses for incentives.

First, let’s recap the previous testnet-related portion of our 2022 Q2 summary.
Uptick Network | Phase I Testnet Statistics

These statistics are based on the snapshot taken on June 30th. We have categorized the qualified testnet addresses into two groups:

1) Testnet Participants

 Qualifying Criteria:

 Not jailed, Uptime > 80%
 Jailed, Uptime >80%
 Participated in governance

2) Test NFT Marketplace Participants

Qualifying Criteria:

Number of NFTs minted
Number of NFTs listed
Number of purchased NFTs & price

Qualified Participant Addresses

Please visit the following link to see if you’ve qualified for testnet incentives:

[Qualified Testnet Airdrop Addresses (GitHub Link)](https://github.com/UptickNetwork/uptick-mainnet/blob/main/Uptick%20Airdrop%20Address%20List%20-%20testnet.txt)

These qualified addresses are whitelisted in the testnet pool of the overall airdrop and incentive program. The scores are secured by the snapshot taken on June 30th. The absolute number of tokens has not been announced yet, because there will be other incentives and airdrop factors to take on board for the overall pool to be counted. Some of these include the existing production version of Uptick NFT marketplace on IRISnet, Uptick NFT on a soon-be-announced L2 partner, and more strategic NFT projects.

As we approach the mainnet launch based on the market situation, the address owners can check their claimable $UPTICK tokens on the ‘Check & Claim’ page (this will be published before the mainnet launch).

Once again, we’d like to thank everyone for their participation in Phase I of the Uptick Network Testnet. Phase II is now underway and we hope you will continue to join us on this journey to mainnet!
