## Seinami Network - Incentivized Testnet

After months of building, Sei Network is almost ready for its maiden voyage, our public launch. But before we set sail, we want to ensure that every last line of code is in shipshape, so we’re launching the Seinami Incentivized Testnet.

We want to provide an opportunity for validators, developers, and traders to test and critique our product. We want the Cosmos community to work closely with our team to shape and refine Sei Network. The Seinami Incentivized Testnet will launch in early July and run for approximately 8-weeks.

In order to fairly compensate participants and reward early adopters, Sei Network will be allocating 1% of its total token supply to testnet rewards. The testnet will consist of 4 acts where participants can earn points by completing testnet missions. Once the testnet period is over, scores for all participants will be calculated. Token rewards will be distributed according to testnet points scored.
Seinami Testnet Goals

We have designed the Seinami Incentivized Testnet with the following goals in mind:

**1. Securing the Network**

Our testnet missions were created to test the usability and security of the Seinami Testnet. We want to ensure that everything functions exactly as it is designed to.

**2. Identifying and Rewarding Early Adopters**

A network is only as good as the set of its validators. Sei aims to foster an innovative and involved set of validators for our mainnet. We’re rewarding participants who strengthen the network, contribute to Sei’s codebase, and write documentation for the good of the community.

**3. Refining Our Product**

We really love what we’ve built, but good products aren’t made in a vacuum. We want the Seinami Testnet to be an opportunity for validators, traders, and developers to give feedback and improve Sei Network.
Seinami Testnet Acts

The Seinami Testnet will be split into 4 acts spread over the course of 2–3 months. Each act will have a different focus/theme for the network with missions to reflect those goals.

**Act 1: Validator Setup**

Aim: Test validator setup workflow and tooling
Duration: 1 week
Participants: Validators only

**Act 2: Exchange and IBC integrations**

Aim: Test exchange and IBC functionality on Sei Network
Duration: 1 week
Participants: Validators and Traders

**Act 3: Smart Contracts and Stress Testing**

Aim: Allow devs to build on Sei, identify bugs, and source improvements
Duration: 3 weeks
Participants: Validators and Developers

**Bug Fix Window**

Duration: 2 weeks

**Act 4: Testing Governance and Bug Fixes**

Aim: Test all fixes and voting mechanisms prior to mainnet launch
Duration: 2 weeks
Participants: Validators, Developers, and Traders

**About Sei Network**

Sei Network is the first orderbook-specific L1 blockchain. It is built using the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint core, and features a built-in central limit orderbook (CLOB) module. Decentralized applications building on Sei can build on top of the CLOB, and other Cosmos-based blockchains can leverage Sei’s CLOB as a shared liquidity hub and create markets for any asset.
