**Upcoming testnet launch **

Five days ago, the coin's team stated that the swap protocol was complete and the launch would take place on Aug. 15. The new protocol of Baby Doge promises a feeless swap of tokens, as well as staking and yield farming. At the time of this writing, BabyDoge is ranked 230th on the CoinMarketCap scale and trading at $0.000000001677. A week ago, in a tweet that announced the upcoming launch of the testnet, it was stated that 100 people who retweeted would join the team of beta testers.

**BabyDoge holder count surges**

In the meantime, @babydogeburn_ account tweeted that another large portion of BabyDoge tokens had been burned, i.e., locked in wallets from which they cannot be withdrawn or otherwise spent. According to the source, a total of 952,493,425,331 BabyDoge tokens were burnt. However, due to the aforementioned low price of BabyDoge, this amount of meme tokens is evaluated only at $1,583. Meanwhile, the holder count of the cryptocurrency is growing. Today, it has reached a new milestone of 1,603,575.
